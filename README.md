Includes an Android app, that allows you to remotely control a Blink presentation and view notes on your device.

**Note on libraries**<br/>
This project uses GreenSocks awesome TweenMax library. The TweenMax license does not allow it to be packaged with the source code, so if you want to build the project, you will have to include the library (v11) yourself:<br />

You can find source code for the iMotion SWC here:<br/>
